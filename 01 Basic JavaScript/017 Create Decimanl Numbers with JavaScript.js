/* Example
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

*/
//NOTE: Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. This can lead to rounding errors. Details Here.
//IMPORTANT: Floating Point Accuracy problems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems

/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE  Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).
//[x] myDecimal should be a number.
//[x] myDecimal should have a decimal point


/* Initial content
const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

*/
