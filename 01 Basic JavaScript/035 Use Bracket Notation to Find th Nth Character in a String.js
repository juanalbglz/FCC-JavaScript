*/

/* Example
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

//NOTE Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

//[x] The thirdLetterOfLastName variable should have the value of v.

//[x] You should use bracket notation.

/* Initial content
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line
*/


/* Solution */
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line
