*/

/* Example
  You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

  i++;
  is the equivalent of

  i = i + 1;
  Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
*/


/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE  Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

/* Initial content
  let myVar = 87;

  // Only change code below this line
  myVar = myVar + 1;

*/


/* Solution */
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar ++;
