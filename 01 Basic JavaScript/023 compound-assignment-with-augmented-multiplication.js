Title:  Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

*/

/* Example
  Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

  myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

  myVar *= 5;

*/


/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
//[x] a should equal 25.
//[x] b should equal 36.
//[x] c should equal 46.
//[x] You should use the *= operator for each variable.
//[x] You should not modify the code above the specified comment.


/* Initial content
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
*/


/* Solution */
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
