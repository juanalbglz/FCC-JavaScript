Title:  Modify Array Data With Indexes

*/

/* Example
  Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

  Example

  const ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
  ourArray[0] = 15;
  ourArray now has the value [15, 40, 30].

  Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.
*/


/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE  Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
//[x] myArray should now be [45, 64, 99].
//[x] You should be using correct index to modify the value in myArray.

/* Initial content
  // Setup
  const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

  // Only change code below this line
*/


/* Solution */
// Setup
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// Only change code below this line
myArray[0] = 45
