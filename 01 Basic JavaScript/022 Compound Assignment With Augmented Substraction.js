*/

/* Example
  Like the += operator, -= subtracts a number from a variable.

    myVar = myVar - 5;
  will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

    myVar -= 5;

*/


/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the -= operator.
//[x] a should equal 5.
//[x] b should equal -6.
//[x] c should equal 2.
//[x] You should use the -= operator for each variable.
//[x] You should not modify the code above the specified comment.


/* Initial content
  let a = 11;
  let b = 9;
  let c = 3;

  // Only change code below this line
  a = a - 6;
  b = b - 15;
  c = c - 1;
*/


/* Solution */
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
