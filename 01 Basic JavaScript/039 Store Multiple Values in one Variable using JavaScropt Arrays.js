*/

/* Example
//IMPORTANT ARRAYS
With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];

*/



/* Exercise*/
//COMPLETE Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

//[x] myArray should be an array.

//[x] The first item in myArray should be a string.

//[x] The second item in myArray should be a number.


/* Initial content
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [];
*/


/* Solution */
// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["myString", 88];
