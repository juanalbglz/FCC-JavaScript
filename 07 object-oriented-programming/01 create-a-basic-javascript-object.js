*/

/* Example
Objects in JavaScript are used to model real-world objects, giving them properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts. Here's an example using these concepts to create a duck object:

  let duck = {
    name: "Aflac",
    numLegs: 2
  };
*/

/* Exercise
TODO Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties, and set them to a string and a number, respectively.
*/

/* Initial content

  let dog = {

};
*/

/* Solution */
let dog = {
  name : "Fido",
  numLegs : 4
};
