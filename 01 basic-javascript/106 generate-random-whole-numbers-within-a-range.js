Title:  Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range

*/

/* Example
  Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

  To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

  Here's the formula we'll use. Take a moment to read it and try to understand what this code is doing:

  Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
*/


/* Exercise*/
  //COMPLETE Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.
  //[x] The lowest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your minimum number, myMin.
  //[x] The highest random number that can be generated by randomRange should be equal to your maximum number, myMax.
  //[x] The random number generated by randomRange should be an integer, not a decimal.
  //[x] randomRange should use both myMax and myMin, and return a random number in your range.


/* Initial content
  function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
    // Only change code below this line
    return 0;
    // Only change code above this line
  }
*/


/* Solution */
function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return myMin + Math.floor((myMax+1-myMin)*Math.random());
  // Only change code above this line
}
